![Betterment](http://saverocity.com/repairproducts/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2013/05/Betterment-Logo.png)

* Betterment was founded in 2008 by Eli Broverman and Jon Stein.  Betterment Holdings Inc, the parent company for Betterment LLC and Betterment Securities was established in Delaware on January 29th, 2008.  Betterment LLC was later established as a Delaware corporation on April 7th, 2009.  In December 2020, Betterment's founder Jon Stein stepped down and was succeeded by Viacom's former COO, Sarah Levy.

* The company's mission is to provide the best possible answer to the question, "What should I do with my money?" to help people to become financially well and free to pursue happiness in their own way and therefore creating a more equitable and just society.

* Betterment received Series A round funding from Bessemer Venture Partners in December, 2010.  By October 2012, Menlo Venures proved SErvies B funding along with BEssemer Venture Partners and Anthemis Group


## Business Activities:

* Over time, money has become complicated.  It's harder to do the right thing.  With today's thousands of investing and retirement options, not to mention all the ways to save and spend money, most engage with dozens of financial companies with little to no guidance.  Betterment is trying to change that by grounding in a few principles.
1. Everyone, not only the wealthy should have access to good, fiduciary guidance.
2. Fiancial technology can provide that access while making money better.
3. Financial services should center itself around people and build solutions for their lives.


* The company is intended for all customers 18 years of age or over.  There is no minimum account balance required for Bettterment investors who use the company's digital plan.  The global robo advosory market size was valued at $4.51 billion in 2019, and is projected to reach $41.07 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 31.8% from 2020 to 2017.  The number of Americans using robo-advisory services is expect to grow from an estimated 2 million in 2018 to 17 million by 2025, based on a survey conducted by the Aite Group in mid-2018.  
Betterment was the first pure robo-adviser in the US.  With a no minoumum account balance requirement, the company opened up opportunities for those who may not meet minimum balance for in-person financial advisors.  It was estimated in 2020 by fool.com that 56% of Americans have $5,000 or less in savings, while a third have $1,000 or less while only 10% of Americans donâ€™t use the internet.

* The first online platform for Betterment in 2008 used a Java application and MySQL database on Apache Tomcat servers with an Adobe Flash- and Flex-based front-end design.


## Landscape:

* Betterment is in the robo-advisory industry and is one of the first to use technology to recommend a portfolio and automate the investment proces. 

* The major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years have been the increasing demand for personalized investment strategies, comprehensive goal-oriented money management, portfolio transparency, tax-loss harvesting, ease-of-use, and low fees.

* The major companies in this domain include Wealthfront, M1 Finance, Charles Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, Fidelity GO, and Wealthsimple.


## Results

* As of March 2020, Betterment has 500,000 accounts with an average account size of $44,000 which is approximately 17% of the projected American market size in 2020 estimated by the Aite Group.

* Some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success include asset-under-management (AUM), account setup, goal setting, account services, portfolio construction, portfolio management, user experience, customer service, education & security, and fees.

* Although behind the largest players like Vanguard Personal Advisory Service and Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, by 2020, Betterment is the largest stand-along robo-advisor with asset-under-management (AUM) at $22 billion, followed by Wealthfront at $21 billion AUM, and Personal Capital at $14 billion AUM.


## Recommendations

* The company has been responding to market demand and competition very quickly. Started as a pure robo-advisor, it recognized the demand for live-person advisory services provided by the largest competitors and already started to provide live-advisor services.  More advertising may help bring awareness to older investors.  The average age of Betterment customers is 35, and about two-thirds are millennials.  Automated investing is new and millennials tend to be early adopters of new technology.  

* The size of investment from younger investors tend to be smaller.   Larger hybrid advisor, Vanguard Personal Advisor Services had an AUM of $161 billion in 2020, more than 7x that of Betterment.  

* Some robo-advisor firms hire marketing agencies to generate traffic to their site.  One simple strategy used by Redhawk Wealth Advisors in Minneapolis is email signatures.  The firm has a link to the robo at th bottom of every email, which allows executives to track which links generate the most leads.  Machine learning could be used to determine when is the highest probability for a person to sign up for the investment platform.

* Machine learning has been adopted widely in marketing.  Determining when, what, and how ads pop up on a potential client's screen can greatly increase sign-up rates.
